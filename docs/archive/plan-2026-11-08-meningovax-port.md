# Plan — bringing PneumoVax's way of working to MeningoVax (REVIEWED DRAFT, 2026-11-08)

**Status: reviewed draft, waiting on the owner. Nothing in MeningoVax has been changed.**
Revised three times on 2026-11-08: (1) the presentation-decision table; (2) the 82-commit
ledger; (3) **a review** at her request (*"Rulebook needs to have the same design philosophies.
Rules for patients need to be consistent as well as logic for when doses need to be repeated"*),
which added the section "Review of the draft", the section "How every dose is decided", and
replaced the eight steps with **nine phases, each with its sessions, its owner stop, and an
estimate**. The tables A–F and the ledger are kept as they were.

MeningoVax repo: `/Users/joannehuang/Downloads/MeningoVax-main`, `main` at `c1118c1` (2026-10-17),
working tree clean on 2026-11-08. PneumoVax's `main` has **83** commits after MeningoVax's twin
`3dc0264` (82 in the ledger plus #147, added below). This is the one real plan for the port; when
work starts, MeningoVax gets a pointer file to it, not a copy (memory `both-apps-docs-are-pointers-not-copies`).

## The goal, in the owner's words (2026-11-08)

> The goal with meningovax is the same as pneumovax. The goal apps is to use age, risk factors
> and prior vaccine history to help assess the appropriateness of prior doses given as well as
> forecast when and what subsequent doses are due. The recommendations should all be pulling
> from the rulebook. Dates or ages when next doses are due should be clearly stated under
> recommendations. Any dose that does not follow standard schedules should have some feedback as
> to if the dose is counted but unnecessary/extra or if doses are valid based on standard/catch up
> schedules, or if doses are valid based on app specific guidance. Invalid doses should also be
> flagged as to whether they should be repeated or not repeated in future doses. Explanations
> under why this or next to dose chips should be stated in simple clear clinical language and
> should not sound AI generated.

## Review of the draft (2026-11-08)

Done by reading MeningoVax's `validate.js`, `intervals.js`, `doseChipLabel.js`, its rulebook
(`docs/agent/meningococcal-rules-summary.md`) and its rule-docs test, and by reading CDC's own
forecasting rule set (CDSI v4.64, local copy at `~/Downloads/Version 4.64 - 508/XML/`, the two
meningococcal files). Each finding below changes what a phase must do.

| # | What the draft said | What is actually there | What changes in the plan |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-1 | "50 commits" in the header | 82 in the ledger, 83 with #147 | Header corrected; #147 added to the ledger |
| R-2 | Ruling D is a *recommendation* fix (step 3): the card advises 9/26, CDC gives 10/17 | **The validator also measures from the last dose that counted** (`prevKeptDated`, `validate.js` lines 597, 920, 990, 1035; the "last-kept" walk, 1074–1236). MeningoVax's own rulebook states the opposite of ACIP as a rule (§4: *"if an early dose is dropped, a later dose isn't wrongly flagged as 'too soon' relative to the dropped one"*). ACIP General Best Practices: *"The repeat dose should be spaced after the invalid dose by the recommended minimum interval."* | Ruling D moves **verdicts**, not just dates: a later dose that counts today may stop counting. It needs the safety nets first, a measured count, and a patient for the owner. Three surfaces, as in PneumoVax: validator, card, chip. |
| R-3 | Early doses: "decision per vaccine" (A16), no method | PneumoVax decided each gap with one method (below, "How every dose is decided"). Applied to CDSI: **CDC's software writes a hard floor (`minimum − 4 days`) on almost every meningococcal gap, boosters included** — the opposite of adult pneumococcal, where every one of 39 gaps had none. So most MeningoVax floors are CDC-backed, and the port is mostly **labelling who says so**, not reversing rules. | Phase 2 builds the rule table with a "who says so" column filled from live readings plus CDSI. Three rows already look different (R-4). |
| R-4 | — | Three gaps where MeningoVax and CDSI differ. **Candidates, not findings** — CDSI ranks below ACIP/CDC wording, and each needs a live read first. (a) *"At least 4 weeks between any two MenACWY doses"* voids a dose (`validate.js:722`); MeningoVax's own rulebook says that 4 weeks is stated by ACIP only for MenB, and CDSI's routine dose-2 floor is 8 weeks − 4 days. Looks like an **app rule with no source** that is labelled as if it had one. (b) High-risk MenB dose 3 under **6 months from dose 1** voids the dose (`validate.js` ~968); CDSI's floor for that gap is **0 days** in both high-risk series (the real floor is 4 months − 4 days from dose 2). (c) Healthy MenB 2-dose series: CDSI carries several interval rows per dose; not yet read against the code. | Owner decision packet 1 (Phase 2 stop), each with a meningococcal patient and a control. |
| R-5 | Labels: map MeningoVax's onto the closed list (A1, decision 5) | **Two vocabulary clashes, not one.** (a) Every invalid MeningoVax dose says *"repeat this dose only (do not restart the series)"*; PneumoVax's W1 calls a dose thrown out for timing *"do not repeat"* because the next dose is simply due once the gap has passed. Same clinical action (one more dose), opposite words. (b) MeningoVax contradicts itself: the chip on a MenACWY dose before 10 / healthy MenB before 16 says **"Off-window - repeat"** (`doseChipLabel.js`), while its rulebook §4 says *"no repeat needed, it's just not counted"*. | Two separate owner questions in Phase 4, asked with patients. |
| R-6 | Step 2: move intervals into one table | The **numbers** are already in one place (`intervals.js`, guarded by `regression-p2-1-intervals-in-one-place`). What is missing is the **rule** table: which rule, voids or advises, who says so, measured from which dose. | Phase 2 is smaller than the draft implied (~1 session). |
| R-7 | Step 7: write a rulebook | MeningoVax's rulebook says it is *"synced to vaxapp"*; vaxapp is retired (memory `vaxapp-is-retired`). Its rule-docs test checks ~30 sentences, not a table cell by cell. | Phase 7 drops the vaxapp sync and builds the generated rule table. |
| R-8 | — | No step names the cross-vaccine question. MenACWY and MenB run on separate clocks, but a **pentavalent** counts for both (`pentavalentCredit.js`). PneumoVax's ANCHOR-1: a dose that did not count never resets **another** vaccine's clock. Unasked for MeningoVax: does a pentavalent rejected for MenB (wrong family) still count, and still anchor, for MenACWY? | Added to decision packet 1. |
| R-9 | — | No step updates MeningoVax's `CLAUDE.md` rules or the `vaccine-parity` skill, so the next session in MeningoVax would not know the new rules exist. | Each phase adds its rule to MeningoVax's `CLAUDE.md`; Phase 9 checks the skill. |
| R-10 | Citations last, "the largest" | MeningoVax has **38** source entries and **21** quotes; PneumoVax has 115 and 97. | Phase 8 is about a third of PneumoVax's citation work, not the whole of it. |

**Correction to R-3, same day, after reading CDC's own words live** (CDC Timing and Spacing
page, content reviewed 2023-08-01; CDC child notes and catch-up table, updated 2025-07-01/02;
ACIP rr6909a1). R-3 rested on CDSI alone and overstated it. CDC's **wording** backs the
primary-series gaps and the minimum ages as floors (the generic rule plus Table 3-2, the
catch-up table's 8 weeks, and the notes' "at least" intervals). It does **not** back the
**booster** gaps as floors: ACIP gives 3, 5, 1 and 2–3 years as the schedule, never as a
minimum, and its only booster warning is that a MenACWY booster under 4 years is
*"not licensed … and considered off-label"*, which is about licensing, not validity. CDSI
alone treats them as floors. So the booster floors are the same kind of question PneumoVax's
adult floors were: **owner decision, packet 1**. Also found: ACIP's routine 16-year booster
needs *"a minimum interval of 8 weeks"* after dose 1, while MeningoVax's catch-all check uses
4 weeks (R-4a, to test in Phase 0); and CDC's notes still give MenQuadfi's minimum age as 2
years, where MeningoVax uses 6 weeks on AAP's word (owner decision of 2026-09-23, stands).

## How every dose is decided — the shared philosophy

This is the part that must be **the same in both apps**, whatever the vaccine. The clinical
numbers differ; the method does not.

### 1. Every rule that can affect a recorded dose is one row, with five answers

| Field | Question it answers | PneumoVax example |
|---|---|---|
| Which schedule | Child or adult rules (MeningoVax: routine, high-risk, single-dose indication) | `rulebook: 'child'` |
| Measured from | The previous dose of the **same vaccine, including one that did not count** (ACIP: the repeat is spaced from the invalid dose), or the last dose **that counted** of a **different** vaccine | Ruling D / ANCHOR-1 |
| What happens if shorter | **Floor**: does not count (4-day grace applies). **Advice**: counts, with a note stating the shortfall. **None**: never flagged, reason written down | `enforcement` |
| Who says so | **CDC/ACIP** only when their own words make it a minimum. **This app** when no source states it — an owner determination, dated, and the app says so in words | `authority` |
| The label it leads to | One label from the closed list (table A1) | §M |

**Never an age test that decides whether a rule may bite** (PneumoVax S14-RC: three adult gaps
fell in that hole and were checked by nothing). Add a row instead.

### 2. Floor, advice, or no rule? Decide in this order

1. **Read the CDC/ACIP sentence live** (`verify-clinical-source`). Words like *"minimum
   interval"*, *"should not be counted"*, *"repeat"* → floor, authority CDC. Watch the trap
   PneumoVax fell into once: *"minimum **recommended** interval"* and *"can be considered"* are
   advice, not a floor.
2. **Check CDSI** (local copy). `absMinInt` above 0 means CDC's software treats it as a floor;
   `0 days` means CDC deliberately set none. CDSI is evidence for the owner, not an authority
   above the prose.
3. **AAP breaks a tie** with CDC; **CDC beats an older immunize.org page**; cite CDC first.
4. **No source at all** → it is an **app rule**: the owner decides, with a worked patient and a
   control case, and the row says *"This app"*. Never cite CDC for it.
5. Put every judgement call in the PR body, grouped, so she audits them in one place.

### 3. Rules every patient gets, in both apps

| Rule | PneumoVax source | MeningoVax today |
|---|---|---|
| A dose given too soon is measured from **itself** when its repeat is scheduled (ACIP) | Ruling D, §L-3 | **No** — validator and card both measure from the last dose that counted (R-2) |
| A dose that did not count never resets **another** vaccine's clock | ANCHOR-1 | Question open (R-8) |
| The 4-day grace decides what the app **accepts**, never what it **advises** | 2026-10-24 ruling | **Yes**, already in its rulebook §0 |
| The grace applies to minimum **ages** too | §A-GRACE12 | Yes (§0 says so); to confirm in code |
| The card advises the **routine** date and states the **minimum** beside it | C10-2 | Minimum only (B2) |
| A dose is **extra** when the card on the day it was given did not ask for it | P1-3 | Only "beyond the series total" (A15) |
| An early dose with no source saying "repeat" **counts, with a note** | PRs #84, #90 | MenB dose 2/dose 3 already do this; the rest per row (R-4) |
| A record problem (future, before birth, twice) gets **neither** a repeat **nor** a next-dose sentence | S10-N2 | **Yes** (PneumoVax copied it from here) |
| **Complete** only when nothing more is owed | §C-COMPLETE | To measure (B3) |
| A line about a later age is the app's own answer run forward, never hand-written | §B-AT19 | To measure (B17: boosters, the 16-year dose) |

## Ground rules for every step

- **Port the rule, not the code.** The two engines are different shapes. Each step starts by
  reading MeningoVax's own `recommend.js` / `validate.js` for that behaviour (memory
  `read-the-engine-before-offering-options`).
- **Nothing pneumococcal carries over.** p2016, PCV7, the PCV15→PPSV23 pairing, the IC/non-IC
  child split, the thrown-out PPSV23 rulings: none of these exist in meningococcal vaccination.
- **Meningococcal rules are read live** from CDC/ACIP before any clinical change
  (`verify-clinical-source` skill). A PneumoVax ruling is never applied to MeningoVax as if
  it were a meningococcal one; where the same QUESTION comes up (for example "is a dose given too
  soon repeated?"), it is put to the owner with a meningococcal patient.
- **One PR per step**, `fix-queue` loop: reproduce, failing test, fix, full suite, break each new
  clause, check in the running app.
- Mirror files stay identical (`dateUtils.js`; the transplant hard stop) — already enforced by tests.

## What MeningoVax has today, against each part of the goal

Surveyed 2026-11-08 by reading the code; each line still to be measured before its step starts.

| Part of the goal | PneumoVax now | MeningoVax now |
|---|---|---|
| Every rule from the rulebook | `CLINICAL_SPEC.md` + a test comparing its rule table to the code cell by cell | `docs/agent/meningococcal-rules-summary.md` + `rule-docs-match-code.test.js` (exists — scope not yet checked) |
| One place for every interval rule | `doseIntervalRules.js`, each row marked "voids the dose" or "advice only" | The NUMBERS are in one place (`intervals.js`, guarded); the RULES that use them are spread through `validate.js` (1,346 lines) and `recommend.js` (R-6) |
| A changed answer cannot slip through | Two committed verdict lists (17,016 real + 18,264 impossible patients) and a prose diff | A shared test grid (`src/test-grid.js`) and three sweeps, but no committed verdict list and no prose diff |
| The app agrees with itself | Seven whole-app checks over 77,496 patients, four of them required tests | None |
| Dates clearly stated | "Next dose due <date>" (Remy, 2026-11-07); the routine date advised, the minimum stated beside it | "Next dose not yet due - eligible <date>" (`RecCard.jsx:472`) |
| Repeat dose measured from the dose given (Ruling D) | Yes | **No, on both sides** — measured 2026-11-01: a 20-year-old with asplenia, Menveo 8/1 then 8/22, is advised 9/26; CDC's rule gives 10/17. Read 2026-11-08: the validator measures from the last dose that counted too, and the rulebook says so as a rule (R-2) |
| Every recorded dose gets one label from a closed list | Yes (§M): counted / extra / valid by catch-up / valid by app rule / not counted–repeat / not counted–do not repeat / record problem | Partly: `doseChipLabel.js` has "Extra dose", "Dose N of M", record problems — but one plain "Invalid" with no repeat / do-not-repeat split |
| Plain clinical wording | Her §M-L3 style rules, swept by test | "Why this" lead/detail split exists; no style rules applied |
| Short card with details behind "Why this" | The fold (WORD-1) — **she chose "PneumoVax only" on 2026-11-06** | Not folded |

## Every PneumoVax presentation decision, and whether MeningoVax has it

Added and completed 2026-11-08 at the owner's request: *"I want to make sure all work on pneumovax is captured in
meningovax plan. This includes consistency with the chip recommendations used, citing sources using
the same superscript order, using the same succinct clinical language throughout etc."*

The first draft of this plan named the five goals but **did not list these decisions**. They are listed
here one by one so that none is lost, and the ledger below marks every PneumoVax commit against them. "MeningoVax now" is from reading its code on 2026-11-08, and
"to measure" means not yet checked. Each row gets measured before its step starts. The **Step**
column says which step below carries it. (Since the 2026-11-08 review, "step N" here is **Phase N** below; the numbers were kept the same on purpose.)

### A. The label and line beside a recorded dose

| # | PneumoVax decision | Where it was decided | MeningoVax now | Step |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Every dose starts with exactly one label from a closed list: Dose N / Dose N of M; Counted — given early, accepted; Counted — not needed; Counted — product not recorded; Counted — date not recorded; Not counted — Extra. Do not repeat.; Not counted — repeat; Not counted — do not repeat; Check the date. | §M, 2026-11-08 | Own list in `doseChipLabel.js`: "Extra dose — more than this series needs", one plain "Invalid", "Off-window - repeat", "Booster" | 4 |
| A2 | Green for counted, blue for extra/not counting, red for not counted, grey for record problems | §M | to measure | 4 |
| A3 | A dose rejected for timing is "do not repeat"; a dose rejected for age or product is "repeat" | W1 (2026-10-11), §M | Uses "repeat this dose only (do not restart the series)" for most invalid doses | 4 |
| A4 | The line beside the label: the label plus one reason; answer first; about the patient, not the document; one idea per sentence; no semicolons, at most one dash; no arguing; never repeats the label; same situation same words; plain clinical terms and US spelling (no "~", "at birth", "about 18 months"); bold only the decision | §M-L3 style rules, 2026-11-08 | Not applied | 6 |
| A5 | Next-dose wording on a dose line: "Next dose from <date> at the earliest". The line never states the due date, because only the card knows the routine date. | 2026-10-24 ruling, §M-L3 rule 9 | to measure | 5 |
| A6 | A dose line never promises a date for a dose no card asks for | §K-NOPROMISE (2026-10-25), §C-P2-R4 (2026-11-08) | to measure | 5 |
| A7 | State the shortfall against the rule ("shorter than the 5 years ACIP advises"), not just the rule | owner, 2026-10-25 | to measure | 6 |
| A8 | Explanations sit under "Why this" beside the dose, not in the line | 2026-10-25; §M "Ok to live under why this for all explanations" | Card notes have "Why this"; dose lines to measure | 6 |
| A9 | A record problem (future date, before birth, entered twice) takes neither a repeat nor a next-dose sentence | S10-N2 | Has this; the wording was ported FROM MeningoVax and has since diverged (§M-L3 note) | 6 |
| A10 | A dose rejected for AGE names no product ("any vaccine approved for that age"); a dose rejected for the wrong PRODUCT names the one to give ("Give PCV20 instead. Do not restart the series.") | §I-AGEREMEDY (2026-10-29), §I-REMEDY (2026-10-26) | to measure | 4 |
| A11 | A thrown-out dose that was later repeated points to the repeat: "Repeated on <date>. See that dose." | §C-P2-LATER, 2026-10-31 | to measure | 4 |
| A12 | Never print a product the record does not show (an unrecorded product reads "a PCV dose", i.e. the vaccine name only) | FINDING H (2026-10-18); PR #103 | to measure | 6 |
| A13 | The 4-day grace decides what the app ACCEPTS, never what it ADVISES: a dose line never gives a date inside the grace | 2026-10-24 ruling | to measure | 5 |
| A14 | "This dose met that minimum" only for a dose that met it | §K-MET-ONLY, 2026-10-31; PR #110 | to measure | 6 |
| A15 | What "extra" means: a dose is extra (not needed, not counted, nothing repeated) when the card the patient had on the day of that dose did not ask for it | P1-3, owner rulings 2026-11-06 (Theo, Mateo, Lena, Ben) | Has an "Extra dose" label for doses past the series total; the "card on that day" test is to measure | 4 |
| A16 | An early dose where no source says to repeat it counts, with a note saying how early ("Counted — given early, accepted"). For PneumoVax adults this was ruled per vaccine (adult table 2026-10-25, PR #90; Ruling F 2026-10-24) | PRs #84, #90, #110 | MeningoVax already counts an early MenB D3 and adds a 4th dose (its CLAUDE.md); other early doses to measure | 4 (decision per vaccine) |
| A17 | A dose given too soon carries two dates that answer different questions: when THIS dose would have been valid (kept in the data) and when the NEXT dose may be given (shown). Both are in the saved-answer files | PR #86 (2026-10-25); 2026-10-24 ruling | to measure | 1 and 5 |
| A18 | The 4-day grace (ACIP General Best Practices) applies to minimum AGES as well as intervals | §A-GRACE12, PR #109 (Lily, 2026-10-31) | to measure | 2 |

### B. The recommendation card

| # | PneumoVax decision | Where it was decided | MeningoVax now | Step |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Top line says "Next dose due <date>", never "eligible" | Remy, §L-2, 2026-11-07 | "Next dose not yet due - eligible <date>" (`RecCard.jsx:472`) | 5 |
| B2 | The app advises the routine date and states the minimum beside it ("it can be given today if needed, as the minimum interval of 4 weeks has already passed") | C10-2, §L-2, 2026-10-23 | States the minimum only | 5 (decision) |
| B3 | "Complete" only when nothing more is owed; "No dose now" while a later dose is still coming | §C-COMPLETE (2026-11-01), P1-2 (2026-11-06) | Uses "Complete"; to measure against the rule | 5 |
| B4 | "Routine" for an on-time patient, "Catch-up" once the routine date has passed | P2-9, §L-2, 2026-11-06 | to measure | 5 |
| B5 | A card never advises an age already passed: it says "was due … and is overdue — it can be given now" | §K-READING 1, 2026-10-24 | to measure | 5 |
| B6 | One date format on screen (`fmtDate`, e.g. "Dec 7, 2026"); the data stays ISO | §K-READING 2, 2026-10-24 | `fmtDate` used in 7 component places; to measure the rest | 5 |
| B7 | Ages in weeks, months and years as the schedules write them, never days | Rulebook review, 2026-10-31 | to measure | 6 |
| B8 | One short clinical line in view, the rest behind "Why this"; disposition in bold | owner, 2026-10-25 | Has the "Why this" lead/detail split (PneumoVax copied it from MeningoVax) | 6 |
| B9 | "Why this" follows the same style rules as the dose lines | §M-L5 / §WHY-THIS, 2026-11-08 | Not applied | 6 |
| B10 | The sentences in view and shut "Complete" cards follow the style rules too | §WORD-TIDY, 2026-11-08 | Not applied | 6 |
| B11 | The result page folds: only what must be seen stays in view (a named list, each with its reason) | §WORD-1, 2026-11-06. **Her answer then: "PneumoVax only"** | Not folded | 6 (decision) |
| B12 | Option cards: "Choose ONE option" wording; each option names its own wait and its own date. Never an option due today beside one due years away under a single "due" | §D-note-8W, P0-1; FINDING A (PR #62) | to measure (pentavalent card) | 6 |
| B13 | No "now" in a sentence under a date still in the future | P2-1 (R9), 2026-11-06 | to measure | 6 |
| B14 | No interval is mentioned when nothing is on the record ("with nothing on the record, a card has nothing to measure from") | P2-10, owner question 2026-11-06 | to measure | 6 |
| B15 | A "Why this" holding only sources is titled "Sources" | PR #135, 2026-11-07 | to measure | 8 |
| B16 | The card's description of the patient matches the patient's real history, both age band and product (never "PCV13" for a PCV15, never "at or after 6" for baby doses) | FINDING G (PR #69), FINDING H (PR #71), §C-AGE6-WORDS | to measure | 6 |
| B17 | A line about a later age (PneumoVax: at 19, at 50) is the app's own answer for the same patient run forward to that age, never hand-written | §B-AT19 (2026-10-31), PRs #129, #134, #136, #139 | to measure (MeningoVax's analogues: boosters, the 16-year dose, MenB at 16–23) | 5 |
| B18 | The patient screen fits a phone: no sideways scrolling, no button past its box | PR #118, owner 2026-11-01 | to measure | 6 |

### C. Sources and superscripts

| # | PneumoVax decision | Where it was decided | MeningoVax now | Step |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Hovering a raised number names the document | C1, 2026-10-17 | **Done** (`c1118c1`) | — |
| C2 | The source buttons sit under a row headed "Sources", and each carries the same number the text uses. **Numbering order is hers (2026-10-17): "The sentences dictate the order the references are listed out"** — the first document a sentence cites is [1]. Numbers and buttons come from one computation (`cardSources()`), never two lists | C2/C3, PR #66 | Not done (C1 only) | 8 |
| C3 | Every number has a button on the card; no number without a button | G2 guard | Not done | 8 |
| C4 | A card credits only the documents that speak for it — each (document, statement) pair is cited or taken off, never left in between | CLAUDE.md "A card credits only…", 2026-10-17 to 10-29 | Not done | 8 |
| C5 | Every quoted source names the patient group it was written about (`population`); a card never shows another group's quote except where declared | 2026-10-17 | Not done | 8 |
| C6 | Cite CDC first; use immunize.org only where CDC does not state the claim | 2026-10-23 | Not done | 8 |
| C7 | One source per claim, one number per sentence a document states; never the same sentence twice | FINDING N, 2026-10-23 | Not done | 8 |
| C8 | Sources row sits inside "Why this" | §WORD-1 decision, 2026-11-06 | Not done | 8 |
| C9 | A CDC link opens the closed section that holds the quoted sentence | #141, 2026-11-07 | Uses `#:~:text=` links; to measure | 8 |
| C10 | A source button comes off a card when its row does not fit the patient (all columns must fit) | §B-JOBAID-NOROW, 2026-10-18 / 11-07 | Not done | 8 |
| C11 | Each number sits on the exact claim its document states (e.g. the word "complete" cites the sentence that says "complete"; a dose TOTAL cites the row that states that total) | P2-7 (2026-11-06); C10-1 (PR #81) | Not done | 8 |
| C12 | Clicking or hovering a number shows the quoted sentence itself, in a pop-up over the number | PRs #114, #141 | Hover names the document (C1); the quote pop-up is to measure | 8 |
| C13 | A quote never says the opposite of its card (e.g. a "no dose now" card quoting "give 1 dose"), and is written about the card's own age band | FINDING C (PR #64), FINDING N (PR #75) | Not done | 8 |

### D. The Rulebook page

| # | PneumoVax decision | Where it was decided | MeningoVax now | Step |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | An in-app Rulebook tab in the app's own decision order, the app's own decisions named and numbered, one source per claim. A row's Source button shows only the sentences that row rests on, and only ones the app's own card for that patient cites; no Source on pure app decisions or on the app's own dose labels | PRs #114, #115, #117, 2026-11-01 | `meningococcal-rules-summary.md` only (no in-app page) | 7 |
| D2 | Her review notes: chronological ages; each group says WHAT changes; which risk wins; weeks/months/years; how products combine; standard schedules first; the dose-chip labels used in the spacing section; opens in its own section; works on a phone (pinned first column, closed parts) | memory `rules-page-owner-design-notes`; PRs #117–#118 | — | 7 |

### E. How PneumoVax keeps itself honest (steps 1 and 2)

| # | PneumoVax practice | Where | MeningoVax now | Step |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Two saved-answer files (real and impossible patients), and every moved answer explained before they are rewritten | S8, 2026-10-12; PR #86 | Not present | 1 |
| E2 | A prose diff of every sentence a clinician reads, including text behind "Why this" | `scripts/proseDiff.mjs`; §K-READING | Not present | 1 |
| E3 | Seven whole-app checks over every patient: advice accepted, plan holds, complete means complete, options agree, card and chip agree, age lines clean, stable over time. Four are required tests | PRs #119, #130, #131, #133 | Not present | 1 |
| E4 | A typical-patient list (ordinary on-time histories), because the main grid cannot build them | PR #119 | Not present | 1 |
| E5 | The app advises and grades by ONE reading of each interval table ("the app had two numbers for one dose") | P0, PR #76, 2026-10-23 | to measure | 2 |
| E6 | Live audits against CDC's own sentences for ordinary patients near each age line | PR #143; PR #87 (CDC's PneumoRecs) | Not present | 1 |
| E7 | The rulebook is held to the code by a test, cell by cell | `rule-docs-match-code.test.js` | Has a test of the same name; scope to measure | 7 |

### F. Already shared by both apps (no work, guarded by test)

`dateUtils.js`; the transplant / CAR-T / B-cell hard stop; the design-review universal rules (no
decorative icons, no pill shapes, CSS custom properties only, three ways to close a pop-up).

**Not to carry over:** anything pneumococcal (p2016, PCV7, PCV15→PPSV23, the IC/non-IC child split, the
thrown-out PPSV23 rulings, the age-19 and age-50 lines).

## Ledger: every PneumoVax commit since MeningoVax last changed

All **82** commits on PneumoVax's `main` after `3dc0264` (C1, the twin of MeningoVax's last
commit `c1118c1`), oldest first, counted with `git rev-list --count 3dc0264..origin/main` on
2026-11-08. Every description was read on 2026-11-08: 7 in full, and the other 75 to the end of their
opening (the first 13–14 lines, where each states its decision and the patient it was decided on). A
row added later from a commit's deeper text is still possible; check a commit in full before
porting the item it is marked with. **Mark:** the table row(s)
above that it decided or changed; **P** = a pneumococcal clinical rule, not carried over; **Docs** =
handoffs and notes only. A commit marked P can still carry a general practice, named beside it.

**When a new PneumoVax commit lands:** add it to this ledger and, if it is not P or Docs, to the table.

## The phases, with sessions, owner stops and estimates

Replaces the draft's eight steps (2026-11-08 review). **One PR per numbered item**, in
MeningoVax, on a branch even though its `main` is unprotected. Each item runs the `fix-queue`
loop: reproduce with a meningococcal patient, failing test, change, full suite, **break each
new clause and quote what fails**, check in the running app (`MeningoVax dev server`, port
5175), commit. A **STOP** means the session ends there with a handoff and waits for her; it
never defaults a decision. "Session" = one 5-hour window.

Estimates use the 2026-11-05 calibration (memory `usage-estimate-calibration`): a full 5-hour
window ≈ 14.5% of a week on the Pro plan; an ordinary fix PR ≈ 2.5%; a rule change with owner
questions and moved patients ≈ 2.5–5%; a whole-app audit ≈ 6.6%. **They are estimates, not
measurements**: re-measure with `get_usage` at the end of Phase 1 and correct this table.

### Phase 0 — Measure, change nothing (1 session, ≈ 6%)

0.1 Add the pointer file `docs/archive/plan-2026-11-08-meningovax-port--SEE-PNEUMOVAX.md` in
    MeningoVax (the pattern its two earlier pointer files use).
0.2 Run MeningoVax's suite and record the real count (2026-11-08 baseline: 1,636 passing, 136 files).
0.3 Fill every "to measure" cell in tables A–E from the code, with file and line.
0.4 List **every place a dose can be rejected, set aside or adjusted** — read on 2026-11-08:
    14 `invalidResult` branches in `validate.js`, plus the not-counted-before-10/16 path, the
    extra-dose path, the early-MenB-dose-2 and early-dose-3 rescue paths, and the three record
    problems. For each: the condition, the words shown, the gap it measures from.
0.5 Read live, and save the quotes: CDC child/adolescent and adult schedule notes
    (meningococcal sections; they are accordions — memory `cdc-notes-pages-are-accordions`),
    ACIP 2020 RR-9, and the 2024 pentavalent MMWR. Put each beside its CDSI row.
**Deliverable:** the measured tables and a one-page rule inventory in `docs/archive/`.
**STOP A — owner:** approve the phase order (no clinical question yet).

### Phase 1 — Safety nets (2 sessions, ≈ 10%)

1.1 Saved-answer files from `src/test-grid.js`: one for real patients, one for impossible
    entries, and the test that fails when either moves (E1). No clinical change.
1.2 The prose diff of every sentence a clinician reads, "Why this" included (E2).
1.3 A typical-patient list — ordinary on-time histories the grid cannot build (E4).
1.4 Whole-app checks, adapted to meningococcal: advice is accepted; the plan holds; complete
    means complete; options agree (pentavalent vs two shots); card and chip agree; age lines
    clean (10, 11, 16, 19, 22, 24 years; 2, 7, 12, 24 months); stable over time (E3).
    **Findings are listed, not fixed.**
1.5 **CDC's CDSI test patients** (M-CDSI-2, added 2026-11-08): run CDC's meningococcal test cases
    through the app and list where it disagrees. See `plan-2026-11-08-cdsi-checks-both-apps.md`.
**STOP B — owner:** she sees how many patients each check flags, grouped by clinical family
with one worked patient each (memory `group-blast-radius-by-clinical-family`). She merges.

### Phase 2 — The rule table (1 session, ≈ 4%)

2.1 A `doseIntervalRules.js`-style table: every row from 0.4, with its five answers as the
    code **behaves today**. `validate.js` calls it once per dose. **0 answers may move** —
    the saved-answer files prove it.
2.2 A "what the sources say" column beside "what the app does", filled from 0.5.
2.3 **CDSI comparison test** (M-CDSI-1, added 2026-11-08): the rule table held against CDSI's two
    meningococcal files, with a named list of deliberate differences. Same plan file as 1.5.
**STOP C — DECISION PACKET 1 (the clinical one).** Each question with a meningococcal patient,
the app's answer today, the answer after, how many patients move, and a control case:
- **Q1 Ruling D** (R-2): the asplenia patient (Menveo 8/1, 8/22). Validator and card.
- **Q2 Each row where app and sources differ** (R-4 a, b, c, plus any 0.5 finds): floor,
  advice, or app rule?
- **Q3 The pentavalent** (R-8): rejected for one vaccine, does it count and set the clock for
  the other?
- **Q4 Rows with no source**: keep as "This app" rules, and in what words?

### Phase 3 — Apply packet 1 (2 sessions, ≈ 8–10%)

3.1 Ruling D on all three surfaces (validator, card, chip), copying PneumoVax's split (the
    anchor moves; dose numbers and totals stay on doses that counted). Rewrite rulebook §4.
3.2 One PR per family of rows Q2/Q4 changed. Every moved answer explained in the PR body
    before the saved-answer files are rewritten.
**STOP D — owner merges each PR.** Nothing in Phase 4 depends on the order inside Phase 3.

### Phase 4 — One label per dose (1 session, ≈ 5%)

4.1 `doseDisposition()` names the verdict already reached; `doseChipLabel.js` words it;
    colours as A2. Covers A1, A3, A10, A11, A15, A16, A18.
**Decision packet 2, asked BEFORE building (STOP E1):**
- **Q5** A dose thrown out for timing: "Not counted — do not repeat" (PneumoVax W1) or
  "Not counted — repeat"? (R-5a)
- **Q6** A MenACWY dose before 10 / a healthy MenB dose before 16: what label? Today
  "Off-window - repeat", against its own rulebook's "no repeat needed". (R-5b)
- **Q7** "Booster": keep it as MeningoVax's own label?
- **Q8** "Extra" means "the card on that day did not ask for it" — apply here?
**STOP E2 — owner merges.**

### Phase 5 — Dates stated plainly (1 session, ≈ 5%)

5.1 B1, B3–B6, B17; A5, A6, A13, A17.
**Decision (STOP F1, before building):** **Q9** advise the routine date and state the minimum
beside it (B2)? Where: MenB dose 3, the MenACWY 16-year dose, boosters.
**STOP F2 — owner merges.**

### Phase 6 — Wording (2 sessions, ≈ 8%)

6.1 Show her five before/after lines and five "Why this" paragraphs (the most-seen), as in
    PneumoVax; she approves the style rules for MeningoVax (**STOP G1**).
6.2 Apply §M-L3, §M-L5 and §WORD-TIDY to every dose line, card and "Why this", with the same
    sweep test (A4, A7–A9, A12, A14, B7–B10, B12–B14, B16, B18).
6.3 **Q10** fold the result page (B11)? Her 2026-11-06 answer was "PneumoVax only"; ask
    again, do not assume. Built only on a yes.
**STOP G2 — owner merges.**

### Phase 7 — The rulebook (2 sessions, ≈ 9%)

7.1 A MeningoVax `CLINICAL_SPEC.md`: every rule with its quote and date, sections in the
    app's own order, the app's own decisions numbered. The rule table generated from the
    Phase 2 describers, held to the code cell by cell (E7). Drop the vaxapp sync (R-7).
7.2 **Q11** the in-app Rulebook tab (D1, D2)? Built only on a yes.
7.3 MeningoVax `CLAUDE.md`: add the non-negotiables this port created (one rule table; a moved
    answer must be explained; one label list; the rulebook is held to the code).
**STOP H — owner reviews the rulebook and merges.**

### Phase 8 — Citations (3–4 sessions, ≈ 20–25%)

C2–C13, in PneumoVax's order: numbered buttons from one computation; `population` on every
quote; each (document, sentence) pair cited or taken off; CDC first; one number per sentence;
links open the closed section; the quote pop-up. One PR per document, each document **read
whole, tables included, before anything comes off a card** (FINDING F).
**STOP after each document** where a removal or a no-row case needs her (her three escalation
cases). Same-dose questions she has delegated (memory `owner-decides-alone-when-dose-unchanged`)
— **ask her once at the start of Phase 8 whether that delegation carries to MeningoVax**.

### Phase 9 — Close (1 session, ≈ 5%)

9.1 Re-run every whole-app check; live audit of ordinary patients near each age line against
    CDC's sentences (E6).
9.2 Check the `vaccine-parity` skill and both `CLAUDE.md` files name the shared rules.
9.3 Handoff; mark this plan finished.

### Totals

| | Sessions | Share of one week (Pro) |
|---|---|---|
| Phases 0–2 (measure, nets, table) | 4 | ≈ 20% |
| Phases 3–5 (rules, labels, dates) | 4 | ≈ 18–20% |
| Phases 6–7 (wording, rulebook) | 4 | ≈ 17% |
| Phase 8 (citations) | 3–4 | ≈ 20–25% |
| Phase 9 (close) | 1 | ≈ 5% |
| **All** | **16–17** | **≈ 80–90%, i.e. most of one week's allowance, spread over 2–3 calendar weeks** |

Items 1.5 and 2.3 (added 2026-11-08) add about 7% and half a session each to Phases 1 and 2.

The calendar time is set by her eleven questions and nine stops, not by the work. If a
findings list from Phase 1 is long (PneumoVax's first whole-app run found families that took
days), add about 2.5% per fix.

## Decisions for the owner, in the order they come up

| # | Question | Phase | Asked with |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q0 | This phase order? | 0 (STOP A) | — |
| Q1 | Ruling D for MeningoVax | 2 (STOP C) | the asplenia patient, Menveo 8/1 and 8/22 |
| Q2 | Each row where the app and the sources differ (R-4) | 2 | one patient per row |
| Q3 | A pentavalent rejected for one vaccine | 2 | a Penbraya after a Bexsero |
| Q4 | Rows with no source: keep as app rules? | 2 | one patient per row |
| Q5 | Timing rejection: "repeat" or "do not repeat"? | 4 | — |
| Q6 | The pre-10 / pre-16 dose label | 4 | a healthy 12-year-old with a MenACWY at 9 |
| Q7 | Keep "Booster"? | 4 | — |
| Q8 | "Extra" = not asked for that day? | 4 | — |
| Q9 | Routine date beside the minimum? | 5 | a high-risk MenB dose 3 |
| Q10 | Fold the result page? | 6 | — |
| Q11 | In-app Rulebook tab? | 7 | — |
| Q12 | Does the "same dose, decide alone" delegation carry over? | 8 | — |

## Not in this plan

- The 23 "Why this" paragraphs over 60 words in PneumoVax.
- Any meningococcal rule that has not gone through `verify-clinical-source`.
